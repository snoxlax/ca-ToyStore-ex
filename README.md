# React + Vite ToyStore Project

I initialized a **Vite project with React**, installed the necessary libraries, and created a **first draft** of the project.

So far, the project includes:

- A **simple list** component
- A basic **ToyStore service** to manage data

This README and the project will be **updated continuously** as new features are added.

## Project Structure

- `src/cmps/` — React components
- `src/pages/` — React pages components
- `src/service/toyService.js` — ToyStore service managing toy data
- `src/App.jsx` — Main app component

---

## Next Steps

- Expand the ToyStore service
- Add more interactive components
- Integrate state management (Redux)
- Add styling and layout improvements
